# machine_learning_tests
Some tests with machine learning in a few jupyter notebooks. Note that for the julia tests, you may need to install a julia kernel in jupyter.

## Keras for python

- keras_test1.ipynb - mnist recognition of handwritten digits
- keras_test2.ipynb - surrogate of a Lorenz 63 small chaotic model

## Flux.jl for julia

- flux_test1.ipynb - compute deriviatives of functions with Flux (no tensors needed)
